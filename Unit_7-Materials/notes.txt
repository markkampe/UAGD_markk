7. Shaders and Materials

    [it has been many months since I worked on this, and so it took me a while to find the
     tutorial entry point on learn.unity.com.  But eventually I found by searching for 
     tutorials on "shaders"]

7.4 Welcome to the Gallery  (getting started)

    dowload the project, unzip it into the appropriate repo subdir

    install an appropriate (6.0) Unity editor (newer than that with which project was saved)

    add the project to UnityHub ... first open very slow due to need for script compillations

    go to the Tutorial Scene, in the hierarchy double-click the Banana object
    observer the colored objects (bananas, apples, pears, cups, ...)

7.5 My work of Art  (widget control)

    7.5.1 scene menu bar, far right, Gizmos
        I can drag 3D brightness down to remove that distraction [not sure what they are for yet]

    7.5.2 scene menu bar, far left, Grid View
        I can enable/disable grid lines in each plane

7.6 Explore Meshes and Rendering

    shaders and materials define how meshes will be rendered

    7.6.2 scenes menu bar, middle rendering mode: wire frame draw mode
          now look at the various objects, see their triangles

    7.6.3 what is a mesh

        a collection of 2D polygons defined by vertices in 3D space
            but these would render as faceted faces
        the vertices/polygons also have "normals" (perpendicular to the face)
            which can turn a flat 2D face into a curved face (enabling smoothing)

        a shader interprets the vertices and normals for rendering

        simple meshes (like a cube) can be done by hand
        more complex (e.g. curved) surfaces are created with tools (e.g. Blender)

    7.6.4 Mesh Filter and Renderer Components

        select an apple, note it has two sub-objects: Body and Stem
        select the body, see that it has a MeshFilter and a MeshRenderer
            the MeshFilter is a collection of connected polygons (the shape)
            the Renderer has a Material, Lighting, Probes, and Settings

    7.6.5 apply a material in the Renderer
        select a not-yet-colored apple
        select the AppleBody sub-component
        note the Material is PlainWhite
        click the Element 0 selector, and select the AppleRed material
        I can then go down to the (newly added) Material and see its attributes

7.7 Exploring Shaders

    A shader renders an object made of a material onto a 2D screen

    7.7.2 there are Fragment and Vertex shaders

        fragment shaders produce the pixels for a surface under the ambient light

        vertex shaders (more complex) tweak the locations of vertices

    7.7.3 Physically based shaders and rendering

        we now have enough computer power to do physics-based ray tracing
        light has brighness, color and range
        surfaces have color, reflectivity and a few other such attributes
        this enables very realistic, light sensitive rendering
            
        there are also non-physics based renderers which simply use material characteristics
        these are suitable for cartoons

    7.7.4 Shaders in the Universal Render Pipeline

        "Lit" shaders are responsive to ambient light
        "Unlit" shaders do not, they are cheaper and appropriate for some stylinzed effects

        select a (yellow) lemon and expand the material
        open up the shader sub-menu
            see all of the available URP shaders
            there are many, each optimized for particular objects/situations
            we are using URP>Lit shader

    7.7.5 Explore Shaders
        
        look at other games and see what shaders others have used

7.8 Manage Materials in a Project

    Shaders do most of the work, but Materials define the attributes (e.g. color
    and smoothness) the shaders use.  Hence, most of what we do will be in the Materials

7.8.3 Fix Magenta Materials

    It is common to import materials that were intended for use with shaders from
    a different pipeline.  When the shader is not available, the material renders
    in magenda.

    Fix the magenta lemon
        select the object, open up the material, change Shader to be URP>Lit

    more general repairs
        Window > Rendering > Render Pipeline Converter
        make sure "Built-in to URP" is selected
        enable "Material Upgrade" option
        select initialize and covert
            Material Upgrade should show "Conversion Completed"
            I can click a list of the converted materials
            [it was not obvious to me how it decided to fix these]

7.8.4 Observe Default Material

    create and place a new sphere
    note its Material (None) and Material (Lit)
    search Materials to find AppleRed

7.8.6 Apply Material to a Game object

    a) drag material to the objcect in the Scene
    b) drag material into the material in the inspector window
    c) in inspector window, click the circle-dot and select desired material

7.8.7 Change Material

    select an AppleBody
    view material in the inspector window
    go to its basemap
    select a different color
    ... all the AppleRed objects will change

7.8.8 Locate Material on Game Object

    select object
    select material
    in Project window, rename (for its new color)

    I stopped at this point

7.9 Simulate Solid Surfaces

    when light hits an object it can reflect, pass through, or be absorbed

    specular reflection is the color of the incoming light
    diffuse reflection is partial absorbtion, and can be a different color

    albedo characterizes the diffuse reflection

    specularity is the degree of specular vs diffuse reflection
        we call this metalicity ... higher metalicity reflects from more angles
        smootheness is a uniformity/brightness of the reflection

    work flow mode can be set to Metalic or Specular

    specular:
        as it becomes smoother, the object takes on the specular (rather than base) color

    metalic:
        smootheness controls glossiness, the focus (tight/diffuse) of the reflected light

    play with these attributes to get the surface/reflection you want

7.9.8   Create a new Material

    Pick a few items in the room, and try to reproduce their color/reflectivity

7.10 Map Materials with Textures

    Maps are 2D images to wrap around an object, e.g. to apply colors to it

    a texture can be any image (e.g. png, jpeg)
        they can have channels (e.g. RGB)
        fourth chanel (alpha) might be transparency
           or smootheness, or metalicity, etc

    they can be created (e.g. w/Blender) or purchased

    select a provided texture (plastic albedo)
        (in inspector) look at its R,G,B,A components

    drag a texture into box at left side of a material's basemap
        or click that circle to get a menu of available textures
