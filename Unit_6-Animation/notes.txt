6 Animation

6.1 a feature about a very sick daughter that made me cry

    we will do some simple animation
    and the create an animated enemy for our game

    Download CreativeCore_Animation_2022.3LTS.zip
    install its contents in Unit_6-Animation
    add project from disk

    Open TutorialScene_Animation_Outdoor
    Open Window > Animation > Animation
    Drag that new tab into the lower half of the editor

6.2 Create first 3D animations

6.2.1 There imported and in-editor animations
    any GameObject or component can be animated
    materials can change over time, lights can go on/off, scripts can be triggered

6.2.2 Create an Animation Clip
    select Ball object
    in Animation tab (on bottom) ... Create "Ball_Pulse"

    note tht I can now:
        Add Property
        Select a Clip view/edit

6.2.3 Set the animation keyframes
    key frames represent key poses
    in-between (tween) frames will connect them ... can be done by tool

    Add Property, dropdown to Transform.Scale, +

    note two diamonds appear at start and end of time-line 
        enabling me to loop between two poses

    now we want to change one of the frames
        select Record
        select 0.25 mark
        increase size of the ball (R, drag)
            (note it is difficult to get all 3 axes the same)

    press Play to watch it happen

    Drag the top diamond from 25->30

    deactivate recording mode

>>> months later I could not find my place or figure out how to resume,
>>> so I went on to Unit 7: Shaders
